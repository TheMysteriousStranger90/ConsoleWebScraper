# ConsoleWebScraper
![Image 1](Screenshots/Screen1.png)

ConsoleWebScraper is a simple console application that allows you to scrape web pages and save the results. It's built in C# and uses .NET Core.

## Features

- **URL Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a URL. It then sends a GET request to that URL and retrieves the HTML content.

- **HTML Parsing**: The program uses regular expressions to parse the HTML content. It can extract inner URLs and images from the HTML.

- **File Saving**: The program can save the scraped URLs, images, and the HTML content (with HTML tags removed) to separate files.

## Usage

1. Open a command prompt as administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the utility.
3. Run the utility as a command-line argument. For example:

    ```
    .\ConsoleWebScraper.exe
    ```
4. When you start the application, you'll see a title and a menu guide. The menu guide will tell you what commands you can use.
5. After the application has successfully completed its operation, the results will be saved on your desktop in a folder named "WebScrapperProject".

## Note

This is a basic web scraper and may not work with all websites, especially those that heavily rely on JavaScript for rendering content or have measures in place to prevent scraping.
